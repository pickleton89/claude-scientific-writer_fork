## [0.1.0] - 2024-12-23

### Added

- Forked from [K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-writer](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-writer) v2.10.0
- This changelog to track customizations and development

### Changed

- Archived original end-user documentation to `docs/` for reference:
  - `CLAUDE.md` → `docs/CLAUDE.original.md`
  - `README.md` → `docs/README.original.md`
  - `CHANGELOG.md` → `docs/CHANGELOG.original.md`
  - `TESTING_INSTRUCTIONS.md` → `docs/TESTING_INSTRUCTIONS.original.md`

### Notes

This fork is being customized for personal/organizational use cases. The original
documentation was oriented toward end-users of the published plugin and CLI tool.
Archiving these files provides a clean foundation for development while preserving
the upstream documentation for reference.

**Upstream baseline:** v2.10.0 (2025-12-21)
