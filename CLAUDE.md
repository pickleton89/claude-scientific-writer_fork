# CLAUDE.md

> Claude Scientific Writer Fork - Development Documentation
> Forked from: [K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-writer](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-writer) v2.10.0
> Last Updated: 2025-12-26

## Project Overview

This is a **customized fork** of the Claude Scientific Writer plugin, adapted for personal/organizational scientific research writing. It is **not production-ready** and should not be installed as a Claude Code plugin.

### What This Fork Is

- A scientific research writing assistant with 18 specialized skills
- Integrated with Oligon brand standards for document generation
- Focused on academic papers, literature reviews, posters, and presentations
- Uses LaTeX with BibTeX as the default output format

### What Was Removed

Clinical and business-focused skills removed to streamline scientific focus:
- `research-grants`, `clinical-decision-support`, `clinical-reports`
- `market-research-reports`, `treatment-plans`

### What Was Added

- `skills/plotting-libraries/` - Python plotting library reference (matplotlib, seaborn)
- `skills/visual-design/` - Design philosophy and publication specifications for scientific visuals
- `src/oligon_reports/` - Python package for branded PDF generation (ReportLab)
- `docs/template-project/brand/` - Oligon brand standards and visual identity
- `INTEGRATION_ANALYSIS.md` - Roadmap for template-project merge

## Agent Behavior

### Role Context

Senior Scientific Software Engineer with focus on Python, R, and Bash tools for data analysis and research computing. CLI-first workflows, automation, reproducible scripts.

### Default Mode

- **Execute directly**: Follow instructions without excessive preamble
- **Zero fluff**: No philosophy or generic tutorials unless asked
- **Stay focused**: Answer exactly what was asked
- **Output first**: Prefer commands, code, or concrete structures
- **Practical defaults**: Make sensible assumptions, clearly stated

### ULTRATHINK Mode

**Trigger**: User types **ULTRATHINK** before a request

When active, suspend brevity and analyze from multiple angles:
- Technical correctness and efficiency
- Data handling and failure modes
- Maintainability and clarity
- Reproducibility and debuggability
- Justify all design choices

### Input Handling

- If key details are missing, make reasonable assumptions and label them
- If errors/logs are provided, prioritize debugging over rewriting
- If ambiguous, choose the simplest viable interpretation

## ⚠️ Skills Development - IMPORTANT

**The `skills/` folder at project root is the ONLY canonical location for skill definitions.**

### Ground Truth

| Location | Status | Action |
|----------|--------|--------|
| `skills/` | ✅ **Canonical** | Edit skills here |
| `.claude/skills/` | ❌ Removed | Was duplicate from upstream |
| `scientific_writer/.claude/skills/` | ❌ Removed | Was installable package copy |

### Why This Matters

The original upstream repo was designed as an installable Claude Code plugin with skills in three locations. Since we're using this as a working project (not installing it), we consolidated to a single source of truth.

### Skill Development Workflow

1. **All skill edits happen in `skills/`**
2. Each skill has a `SKILL.md` defining its capabilities
3. Skills may include `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` subdirectories
4. Cross-reference related skills (e.g., scientific-writing → venue-templates)

## Python Package (`scientific_writer/`)

A standalone Python package for programmatic paper generation **outside of Claude Code**. Not needed when working directly in Claude Code.

- **CLI**: `uv run scientific-writer` - Interactive terminal interface
- **API**: `from scientific_writer import generate_paper` - For automation
- **Docs**: See `scientific_writer/README.md` for usage details

Uses `claude-agent-sdk` to call Claude with WRITER.md instructions.

## Development Workflow

### Human-in-the-Loop Approach

**I prefer to be actively involved in development decisions.** Please follow these guidelines:

- **Don't auto-implement**: Do not start changing files without discussing the plan first
- **Plan before coding**: For substantial changes, create an implementation document or plan
- **Discuss trade-offs**: Present options and let me make architectural decisions
- **Incremental progress**: Break large tasks into reviewable steps

### Implementation Documents

For substantial changes or new features, create a planning document first:

1. **Problem statement**: What are we solving?
2. **Proposed approach**: How will we solve it?
3. **Files affected**: What will change?
4. **Trade-offs**: What are the alternatives and their pros/cons?
5. **Execution phases**: Break into manageable steps

Examples of documents created for this fork:
- `INTEGRATION_ANALYSIS.md` - Template-project merge strategy
- `SKILL_REMOVAL_PLAN.md` - Clinical skill removal (completed, archived to CHANGELOG)

### Making Changes

1. Discuss changes before implementation
2. Create planning docs for substantial work
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md` for significant changes
4. Use conventional commit messages with Claude Code attribution

### Git Workflow

```bash
# Standard commit format
git commit -m "type: description

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

## Coding Standards

### Engineering Philosophy: Intentional Code

- **Anti-generic**: Avoid copy-paste patterns without justification
- **Purpose first**: Every line should serve a clear function
- **Minimalism**: Fewer moving parts > clever abstractions
- **Predictability**: Explicit behavior beats implicit magic

### Language-Specific Standards

**Python**
- Clear functions with explicit inputs/outputs
- Minimal dependencies; use stdlib when possible
- Type hints for public interfaces

**R**
- Scriptable and analysis-focused
- Reproducible results (set seeds, document versions)

**Bash**
- Safe defaults: `set -euo pipefail`
- Portable where possible
- Never run destructive commands without preview

### General Practices

- Prefer existing, well-known tools over custom reinvention
- Avoid loading large data into memory unless necessary
- Never propose destructive commands without a safe preview

## Integration Roadmap

See `INTEGRATION_ANALYSIS.md` for the 5-phase plan to merge template-project concepts:

1. **Phase 1**: Template infrastructure (schemas, markdown templates)
2. **Phase 2**: Component extension (FindingCard, StatusTable, etc.)
3. **Phase 3**: Skill creation (`markdown-to-pdf` unified skill)
4. **Phase 4**: Document type expansion (meeting-notes, project-status, etc.)
5. **Phase 5**: Integration polish and testing
