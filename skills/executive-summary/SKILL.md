# Executive Summary

## Objective

Generate concise, persuasive executive summaries that enable decision-makers to understand key findings and take action without reading the full document. Apply the Pyramid Principle: lead with conclusions, support with evidence, end with a clear call to action.

**Why this matters:** Decision-makers typically have 2-3 minutes to evaluate a document. A well-structured executive summary captures attention, builds confidence in findings, and drives action—while a poorly structured one gets ignored.

---

## Quick Start

For straightforward summarization tasks, follow this minimal workflow:

1. **Read the source document** using the Read tool
2. **Extract 3-5 key findings** with quantified results
3. **Identify the primary recommendation**—what action should the reader take?
4. **Draft using the five-component template** (see below)
5. **Validate** by running `python3 {baseDir}/scripts/validate_summary.py output.md`

---

## Core Constraints

Apply these constraints to every executive summary:

| Constraint | Requirement | Rationale |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Length** | Maximum 1-2 pages OR ~10% of source document | Busy readers abandon long summaries |
| **Timing** | Write AFTER the full document is complete | Cannot summarize incomplete work |
| **Independence** | Must stand alone—never reference "Section 3.2" | Reader may never see the main document |
| **Audience** | Intelligent non-specialists who need to decide | Avoid jargon; explain technical terms |

---

## The Pyramid Principle

Structure every executive summary with **conclusion first**, then supporting evidence. The reader must grasp the essential message in the first paragraph.

**Why this structure:** Research shows readers form opinions in the first 30 seconds. Front-loading the conclusion ensures your key message lands even if the reader stops early.

### Five-Component Structure

Include all five components in this order:

| # | Component | Purpose | What to Write |
|---|-----------|---------|---------------|
| 1 | **Hook/Problem** | Capture attention | One sentence stating the specific problem with a compelling statistic |
| 2 | **Solution/Objective** | Frame the approach | 1-2 sentences on methodology or proposed solution |
| 3 | **Key Findings** | Provide evidence | Exactly 3-5 quantified insights (never more) |
| 4 | **Value/Impact** | Answer "so what?" | ROI, benefits, or broader significance |
| 5 | **Call to Action** | Drive decision | Specific next step with owner and timeline |

### Template

Use this exact structure for every executive summary:

```markdown
## Executive Summary

[HOOK: One sentence with specific problem/opportunity + key statistic]

[SOLUTION: 1-2 sentences describing methodology or approach]

**Key Findings:**
1. [Finding with number]: [quantified result]
2. [Finding with number]: [quantified result]
3. [Finding with number]: [quantified result]

[VALUE: 2-3 sentences on significance, ROI, or implications]

**Recommendation:** [Specific action] by [owner] by [date/timeline].
```

## Complete Example

### Input Context
A 15-page research report on employee productivity after implementing remote work policies.

### Generated Executive Summary

```markdown
## Executive Summary

Remote work implementation has increased employee productivity by 23% while reducing
operational costs by $1.2M annually—but sustaining these gains requires immediate
investment in collaboration infrastructure.

This analysis examined productivity metrics, employee satisfaction, and operational
costs across 847 employees over 18 months following our March 2024 remote work policy.

**Key Findings:**
1. **Productivity increased 23%**: Average task completion rose from 34 to 42 tasks/week
2. **Attrition dropped 31%**: Voluntary departures fell from 18% to 12.4% annually
3. **Collaboration declined 15%**: Cross-team project velocity decreased significantly
4. **Cost savings reached $1.2M**: Reduced facility and commuting subsidies

These results position the company to reinvest savings into growth initiatives while
maintaining the flexibility that drives retention. However, declining collaboration
threatens long-term innovation capacity.

**Recommendation:** Approve $400K for collaboration tool upgrades and quarterly
in-person team events by Q2 2025. VP of Operations to present implementation plan
by January 15.
```

**Why this example works:**
- Opens with conclusion (productivity up, costs down) + tension (collaboration declining)
- Exactly 4 findings, all quantified with specific numbers
- Value statement connects to strategic goals
- Call to action specifies: amount, purpose, timeline, and owner

## Writing Rules

Apply these rules to transform technical content into accessible prose:

### 1. One Idea Per Paragraph

**Rule:** Each paragraph addresses exactly one main point.

**Test:** Can you summarize the paragraph in one sentence? If not, split it.

**Why:** Multiple ideas per paragraph force re-reading and slow comprehension.

### 2. Active Voice

**Rule:** Use direct, active constructions. The actor should perform the action.

| Write This (Active) | Not This (Passive) |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| "We measured response times..." | "Response times were measured..." |
| "The analysis shows..." | "It was determined that..." |
| "The committee recommends..." | "A recommendation was made..." |

**Why:** Active voice is 20-25% shorter and assigns clear accountability.

### 3. Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)

**Rule:** Structure each paragraph with:
1. **Context**: Topic sentence (what this paragraph addresses)
2. **Content**: Evidence, data, or argument
3. **Conclusion**: Take-home message connecting to main thesis

**Why:** This structure guides readers through complex information without confusion.

### 4. Translate Jargon

**Rule:** Replace technical terms with plain language. If a technical term is essential, define it immediately.

| Technical | Plain Language |
|-----------|----------------|
| "p-value < 0.001" | "statistically significant (p<0.001), meaning unlikely due to chance" |
| "RNA-seq analysis" | "gene activity analysis using RNA sequencing" |
| "ROI of 340%" | "return of $3.40 for every $1 invested" |

**Why:** Decision-makers span domains. Undefined jargon creates barriers to understanding and trust.

## Visualization Integration

Include a visual summary when the executive summary will be:
- Presented to diverse stakeholders (varying technical backgrounds)
- Used in slide decks or board materials
- Distributed as a standalone document via email

### When to Add Visuals

| Scenario | Include Visual? |
|----------|----------------|
| Board presentation | Yes—graphical abstract |
| Email to executives | Yes—single summary chart |
| Internal team memo | Optional |
| 1-page summary | Only if space allows |

### Technical Requirements

All visuals must meet these standards:

| Requirement | Standard | Rationale |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **Format** | Vector only (PDF, SVG) | Scales without pixelation |
| **Colors** | No red/green; use blue/orange or Viridis | 8% of men are red-green colorblind |
| **Chart type** | Bar charts for comparisons | Pie charts distort perception |
| **Effects** | No 3D, shadows, or gradients | "Chartjunk" obscures data |
| **Captions** | Self-contained | Reader may see figure without text |
| **Fonts** | Sans-serif, ≥8pt | Legibility on screens and print |

For detailed visualization guidance, see `references/visualization_guidelines.md`.

## Workflow

### Standard Process

Execute these steps in order:

**Step 1: Verify Prerequisites**
```
Read the source document.
Confirm it is complete—do not summarize incomplete drafts.
If incomplete, STOP and notify the user: "The source document appears incomplete.
Please provide the final version before I generate the executive summary."
```

**Step 2: Extract Key Content**
```
Identify the 3-5 most important findings.
Each finding MUST have a quantified result (number, percentage, dollar amount).
If findings lack quantification, note this gap for the user.
```

**Step 3: Determine the Recommendation**
```
Identify what action the reader should take.
The recommendation must specify: WHAT, WHO, and WHEN.
If no clear action emerges, ask the user: "What decision should this summary support?"
```

**Step 4: Draft the Summary**
```
Use the five-component template exactly.
Write in active voice.
Ensure total length is ≤10% of source document.
```

**Step 5: Validate**
```
Run the validation script:
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/validate_summary.py <output_file>

Review the output for:
- PASS: All criteria met
- WARN: Minor issues to consider
- FAIL: Must fix before delivering
```

**Step 6: Revise if Needed**
```
If validation returns FAIL or WARN:
1. Address each issue identified
2. Re-run validation
3. Repeat until all checks pass
```

**Step 7: Deliver**
```
Present the validated executive summary to the user.
Include the validation results as confirmation of quality.
```

## Error Handling

Handle these common scenarios:

### Source Document Issues

| Scenario | Detection | Response |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Document incomplete** | Missing sections, "TBD" markers, blank areas | STOP. Notify user: "Source document appears incomplete. Please provide final version." |
| **Document too short** | Source < 500 words | WARN user: "Source is brief. Executive summary may be as long as the original. Consider whether a summary is needed." |
| **No quantified findings** | Findings lack numbers | Extract what exists. WARN user: "Findings lack quantification. Summary will be less compelling. Can you provide metrics?" |

### Content Challenges

| Scenario | Detection | Response |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Fewer than 3 findings** | Cannot identify 3+ distinct insights | Include what exists. Note: "Only [N] key findings identified. Consider whether source contains sufficient content." |
| **No clear recommendation** | Cannot determine action | Ask user: "What decision should this summary support? I need a clear action to recommend." |
| **Multiple competing recommendations** | Source suggests conflicting actions | Present options to user: "Source contains multiple potential recommendations. Which should I prioritize?" |

### Output Constraints

| Scenario | Detection | Response |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **User requests longer summary** | Request exceeds 10% guideline | WARN: "Extended summaries reduce effectiveness. Recommend staying under [X] words. Proceed with longer version?" |
| **User requests bullet-only format** | No prose requested | Deliver bullets but WARN: "Bullet-only format may reduce persuasive impact. Consider adding narrative framing." |

## Quality Thresholds

### Writing Metrics

| Metric | Fail | Minimum | Target | Excellent |
|--------|------|---------|--------|-----------|
| Sentence length (avg) | >30 words | ≤25 words | 15-20 words | 12-18 words |
| Passive voice | >50% | ≤40% | ≤25% | ≤15% |
| Undefined jargon | >5 terms | ≤5 terms | All defined | 0 jargon |
| Call to action | Missing | Present | Specific | Specific + Owner + Timeline |
| Quantified findings | 0-1 | 2 | 3-4 | 5 with comparisons |

### Validation Script

Run quality checks using:

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/validate_summary.py <markdown_file>
```

The script checks:
- Word count and length ratio
- Passive voice percentage
- Component presence (all 5 required)
- Quantification in findings
- Call-to-action specificity

## Common Pitfalls

Avoid these errors that reduce executive summary effectiveness:

| Pitfall | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Burying the lead** | Reader may stop before reaching conclusion | Move recommendation to first paragraph |
| **Data dump** | Overwhelms reader; obscures key points | Limit to 3-5 findings; move details to appendix |
| **Vague language** | "Improvements were made" lacks credibility | Quantify: "Efficiency improved 34%" |
| **Passive hedging** | "It could be considered..." sounds uncertain | Be direct: "We recommend..." |
| **Referencing main doc** | "As shown in Section 3.2..." | Restate the point—summary must stand alone |
| **Missing action** | Reader finishes without knowing next step | Always end with specific call to action |
| **Wall of text** | No visual breaks reduce readability | Use headers, bullets, bold for key terms |
