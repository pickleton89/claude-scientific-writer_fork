## Example 1: Remote Work Productivity Analysis

### Input Context

A 15-page research report on employee productivity after implementing remote work policies.

### Generated Executive Summary

```markdown
## Executive Summary

Remote work implementation has increased employee productivity by 23% while reducing
operational costs by $1.2M annually—but sustaining these gains requires immediate
investment in collaboration infrastructure.

This analysis examined productivity metrics, employee satisfaction, and operational
costs across 847 employees over 18 months following our March 2024 remote work policy.

**Key Findings:**
1. **Productivity increased 23%**: Average task completion rose from 34 to 42 tasks/week
2. **Attrition dropped 31%**: Voluntary departures fell from 18% to 12.4% annually
3. **Collaboration declined 15%**: Cross-team project velocity decreased significantly
4. **Cost savings reached $1.2M**: Reduced facility and commuting subsidies

These results position the company to reinvest savings into growth initiatives while
maintaining the flexibility that drives retention. However, declining collaboration
threatens long-term innovation capacity.

**Recommendation:** Approve $400K for collaboration tool upgrades and quarterly
in-person team events by Q2 2025. VP of Operations to present implementation plan
by January 15.
```

### Why This Example Works

| Element | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Hook** | Opens with conclusion (productivity up, costs down) + tension (collaboration declining) |
| **Solution** | One sentence on methodology (847 employees, 18 months) |
| **Findings** | Exactly 4 findings, all quantified with specific numbers |
| **Value** | Connects to strategic goals (reinvestment, retention, innovation) |
| **CTA** | Specifies: amount ($400K), purpose (tools + events), timeline (Q2 2025), owner (VP of Operations) |

## Example 2: Market Expansion Proposal

### Input Context

A 20-page market research report evaluating expansion into the European market.

### Generated Executive Summary

```markdown
## Executive Summary

European market entry represents a $45M revenue opportunity with 340% projected ROI
over three years—but requires immediate commitment to capture the Q3 2025 regulatory
window.

Our analysis assessed market size, competitive landscape, regulatory requirements, and
operational readiness across 12 EU countries using proprietary market modeling and
interviews with 34 regional distributors.

**Key Findings:**
1. **Market opportunity: $45M**: Addressable market in Northern Europe alone
2. **Competitive gap exists**: No dominant player in the mid-market segment we target
3. **Regulatory window closing**: New compliance requirements take effect January 2026
4. **Infrastructure ready**: Existing logistics partnerships cover 8 of 12 target countries

Early entry establishes brand presence before regulatory barriers increase acquisition
costs by an estimated 60%. Delay beyond Q3 2025 risks ceding first-mover advantage to
competitors already positioning for entry.

**Recommendation:** Approve Phase 1 expansion budget of $8.2M and authorize VP of
International to begin regulatory filings by March 1, 2025.

## Anti-Example: What NOT to Do

The following example violates multiple best practices:

```markdown
## Executive Summary

This report examines various aspects of our operations. Several areas were looked at
and some interesting findings were discovered.

As discussed in Section 3.2, there were improvements in some metrics. The data in
Table 4 shows trends that might be relevant. Please refer to Appendix B for details.

Some things went up and others went down. Overall, the situation is complex and
requires further analysis. We should probably consider doing something about this
at some point.

It is recommended that management review these findings.
```

### Problems with This Example

| Issue | Problem |
|-------|---------|
| **Buries the lead** | No conclusion in first paragraph |
| **Passive voice** | "were looked at", "were discovered", "is recommended" |
| **Section references** | "Section 3.2", "Table 4", "Appendix B" violate standalone requirement |
| **No quantification** | "some", "various", "several" instead of numbers |
| **Vague language** | "interesting", "might be relevant", "at some point" |
| **Weak CTA** | No specific action, owner, or timeline |

## Template for New Summaries

Use this template as a starting point:

```markdown
## Executive Summary

[HOOK: One sentence with specific problem/opportunity + key statistic]

[SOLUTION: 1-2 sentences describing methodology or approach]

**Key Findings:**
1. [Finding with number]: [quantified result]
2. [Finding with number]: [quantified result]
3. [Finding with number]: [quantified result]

[VALUE: 2-3 sentences on significance, ROI, or implications]

**Recommendation:** [Specific action] by [owner] by [date/timeline].
```
