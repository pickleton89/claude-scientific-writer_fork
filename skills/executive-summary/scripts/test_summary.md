## Executive Summary

Remote work implementation has increased employee productivity by 23% while reducing operational costs by $1.2M annually—but sustaining these gains requires immediate investment in collaboration infrastructure.

This analysis examined productivity metrics, employee satisfaction, and operational costs across 847 employees over 18 months following our March 2024 remote work policy.

**Key Findings:**
1. **Productivity increased 23%**: Average task completion rose from 34 to 42 tasks/week
2. **Attrition dropped 31%**: Voluntary departures fell from 18% to 12.4% annually
3. **Collaboration declined 15%**: Cross-team project velocity decreased significantly
4. **Cost savings reached $1.2M**: Reduced facility and commuting subsidies

These results position the company to reinvest savings into growth initiatives while maintaining the flexibility that drives retention. However, declining collaboration threatens long-term innovation capacity.

**Recommendation:** Approve $400K for collaboration tool upgrades and quarterly in-person team events by Q2 2025. VP of Operations to present implementation plan by January 15.
