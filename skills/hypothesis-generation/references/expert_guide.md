## 1. Core Principles

1. **Mechanism over description.** A hypothesis must explain *how* and *why*, not just *what*. "X correlates with Y" is an observation; "X causes Y through mechanism Z" is a hypothesis.

2. **Falsifiability is non-negotiable.** If no conceivable observation could disprove it, it's not a scientific hypothesis. Specify what would falsify before designing what would confirm.

3. **Competing explanations, not single bets.** Generate 3-5 distinct hypotheses, not one favored explanation. Science advances by eliminating alternatives, not confirming favorites.

4. **Abductive reasoning requires humility.** Hypothesis generation is "inference to the best explanation"—which means the best *current* explanation given *current* evidence. New data should trigger revision, not defense.

5. **Parsimony with purpose.** Prefer simpler explanations, but don't sacrifice explanatory power for simplicity. The goal is the simplest hypothesis that accounts for all observations, not the simplest hypothesis period.

## 2. Decision Framework

| When... | Then... |
|---------|---------|
| Observation is unexpected | First verify the observation is real (replication, controls), then generate explanations |
| Multiple mechanisms could explain | Design experiments that distinguish between them, not just confirm one |
| Existing theory partially explains | Propose extensions or modifications, not wholesale replacement |
| Variables are hard to define | Operationalize precisely before hypothesizing relationships |
| Phenomenon spans domains | Seek analogies from related systems; cross-pollinate mechanisms |
| Initial experiments fail to confirm | Consider the hypothesis wrong before questioning the methods |
| Hypothesis seems obviously true | Identify what would falsify it; if nothing, it's not testable |

**Key trade-offs:**
- **Specificity vs. generality**: Specific hypotheses are easier to test but explain less; general ones explain more but are harder to falsify
- **Parsimony vs. completeness**: Simpler is better until it fails to account for observations
- **Boldness vs. incrementalism**: Bold hypotheses drive paradigm shifts; incremental ones accumulate evidence

## 3. Concrete Patterns

**Pattern 1: The Mechanism Probe**
- [Situation] → Correlation observed between X and Y
- [Action] → Ask "What would have to be true for X to cause Y?" Identify intermediate steps, propose mechanism, then design experiment targeting a specific step.
- [Rationale] → Correlations are cheap; mechanisms are valuable. Testing a mechanism simultaneously tests the hypothesis and builds understanding.

**Pattern 2: The Strong Inference Method**
- [Situation] → Phenomenon could have multiple explanations
- [Action] → Generate 3+ competing hypotheses, then design a single "crucial experiment" whose outcome definitively eliminates at least one.
- [Rationale] → Platt's 1964 Strong Inference: progress comes from eliminating alternatives, not confirming favorites. One decisive experiment beats ten confirmatory ones.

**Pattern 3: The Falsification First**
- [Situation] → You have a promising hypothesis
- [Action] → Before testing for confirmation, explicitly state: "This hypothesis would be falsified if we observe [X]." Design the experiment to look for X.
- [Rationale] → Confirmation bias is the default mode. Actively seeking falsification counteracts it and produces more robust hypotheses.

## 4. Failure Modes

| Mistake | Why It Fails |
|---------|--------------|
| **Vague formulation** | "X affects Y" provides no testable prediction; no experiment can confirm or refute it |
| **Single-hypothesis fixation** | Emotional attachment leads to confirmation bias; alternatives never considered |
| **Confusing correlation with mechanism** | "X and Y co-occur" is observation, not explanation; stops inquiry prematurely |
| **Untethered speculation** | Hypotheses without grounding in literature or observation are unfalsifiable speculation |
| **Over-specification** | Hypotheses so specific they only apply to one dataset lack generalizability |
| **Variable conflation** | Poorly defined variables mean different experiments test different things |
| **Confirmation-only design** | Experiments designed only to confirm can never falsify; wasted effort |

## 5. Anti-Patterns

**Never do these, even if they seem efficient:**

- Generate only one hypothesis (always generate competing alternatives)
- Formulate hypotheses before reviewing existing literature
- State hypotheses in unfalsifiable terms ("may," "might," "could contribute to")
- Confuse the hypothesis with the prediction (hypothesis = explanation; prediction = observable consequence)
- Let emotional attachment to a hypothesis influence experimental design
- Ignore negative results that contradict your favored hypothesis
- Use complexity to obscure lack of mechanism (jargon ≠ explanation)

## 6. Quality Signals

| Good Enough | Excellent |
|-------------|-----------|
| Testable prediction stated | Falsification conditions explicitly specified |
| Grounded in some evidence | Grounded in systematic literature synthesis |
| Single hypothesis proposed | 3-5 competing hypotheses with discriminating experiments |
| Variables defined | Variables operationalized with measurement protocols |
| Mechanism implied | Mechanism articulated with intermediate steps |
| Explains target observation | Explains target AND predicts novel observations |

**Subtle expert markers:**
- Hypotheses distinguish between necessary and sufficient conditions
- Predictions specify direction AND magnitude of expected effects
- Competing hypotheses are genuinely distinct, not minor variations
- Acknowledges which assumptions, if wrong, would invalidate the hypothesis
- Identifies what the hypothesis does NOT explain (scope boundaries)

## Final Synthesis

**Do This:**
- Always generate 3-5 competing hypotheses, not just your favorite
- State falsification conditions before confirmation experiments
- Ground hypotheses in systematic literature review
- Articulate mechanism (how/why), not just relationship (what)
- Design experiments that discriminate between alternatives

**Not That:**
- Don't formulate vague hypotheses ("X may affect Y")
- Don't test only for confirmation
- Don't ignore literature before hypothesizing
- Don't confuse correlation with mechanism
- Don't treat your first hypothesis as precious

**When In Doubt:**
Ask: "What observation would convince me this hypothesis is wrong?" If you can't answer, the hypothesis isn't ready to test.

**Quality Check:**
1. Is the hypothesis falsifiable—can I specify what would disprove it?
2. Have I generated competing alternatives, or am I fixated on one?
3. Does the hypothesis explain mechanism (how/why), not just correlation?
4. Is it grounded in existing evidence and literature?
5. Are variables precisely defined and operationalizable?
6. Does the experimental design discriminate between alternatives?
