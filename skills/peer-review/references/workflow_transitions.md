**Progress indicators:**
- 25%: Central research question identified
- 50%: Main findings and conclusions noted
- 75%: Venue appropriateness assessed
- 100%: Initial impression documented, ready for deep review

---

- [ ] Materials availability confirmed

**Progress indicators:**
- 25%: Data availability assessed (repositories, accession numbers)
- 50%: Code and materials availability checked
- 75%: Reporting guideline compliance verified
- 100%: Protocol detail sufficiency evaluated, issues documented

---

## Stage 5 → 6: Figure Evaluation → Ethical Considerations

**Exit criteria:**

- [ ] Colorblind accessibility checked
- [ ] Image integrity verified (no manipulation concerns)
- [ ] Figure quality scores documented

**Progress indicators:**
- 25%: Figure resolution and labeling quality checked
- 50%: Error bars and statistical indicators verified
- 75%: Image integrity checked (manipulation, duplications)
- 100%: Figure clarity assessed, quality scores documented

---

## Stage 6 → 7: Ethical Considerations → Writing Quality

**Exit criteria:**

**Progress indicators:**
- 25%: Human subjects (IRB, consent) verified if applicable
- 50%: Animal research (IACUC, 3Rs) verified if applicable
- 75%: Conflicts of interest and funding checked
- 100%: Authorship and integrity concerns assessed

---

## Stage 7 Complete: Writing Quality → Report Drafting

**Exit criteria:**

## Quick Transition Checklist

Use this condensed checklist to verify readiness for next stage:

| From → To | Key Gate |
|-----------|----------|
| 1 → 2 | Have clear summary + initial recommendation |
| 2 → 3 | All sections documented with specific concerns |
| 3 → 4 | Statistical validity + design rigor assessed |
| 4 → 5 | Data/code availability + guideline compliance checked |
| 5 → 6 | Figure quality + integrity verified |
| 6 → 7 | Ethics approvals + disclosures confirmed |
| 7 → Report | Writing quality assessed, findings synthesized |
