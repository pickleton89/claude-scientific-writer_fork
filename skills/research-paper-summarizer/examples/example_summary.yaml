overview: |
  This study developed aptamer-siRNA chimeras targeting EpCAM-positive pancreatic cancer 
  cells for selective KRAS gene silencing. Using a modular assembly approach with a 
  sticky-bridge linker, the authors achieved tumor-selective delivery and significant 
  knockdown in vivo, resulting in tumor growth inhibition in xenograft models.

  author_stated:
    - "Single tumor model (BxPC-3) may not represent pancreatic cancer heterogeneity"
    - "Maximum treatment duration of 6 weeks; long-term efficacy unknown"
    - "Humanized mouse models not used; immune component not assessed"
  additional:
    - "No comparison to standard-of-care gemcitabine combination"
    - "Biodistribution assessed only at single timepoint (24h)"
    - "Manufacturing scalability not addressed"

implications: |
  This work demonstrates feasibility of aptamer-mediated siRNA delivery for oncogene 
  silencing in solid tumors. The modular assembly approach enables rapid optimization 
  of targeting and payload components. Authors propose IND-enabling studies with 
  GMP manufacturing and expanded toxicology in non-human primates.

relevance_notes: |
  Directly relevant to SeekR platform development. Key insights for our work:
  
  1. The sticky-bridge linker approach is similar to our modular assembly strategy
  2. 2'F-pyrimidine + PS modifications achieved adequate stability (72h serum half-life)
  3. 5 mg/kg bi-weekly dosing achieved therapeutic effect — useful benchmark
  4. The 72% knockdown at 48h suggests our efficacy prediction cutoffs may be appropriate
  
  Consider: Their EpCAM aptamer (Kd 2.3 nM) outperforms our current CD71 aptamer. 
  May be worth testing EpCAM for pancreatic applications.
