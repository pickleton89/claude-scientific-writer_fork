---

## Phase 0: Initialization

### User provides PDF

```
User: Summarize this paper for me
[Uploads chen2024_aptamer_sirna_chimeras.pdf]
```

### Claude reads and analyzes PDF

```

User: 1
```

---

## Phase 1b: Section Detection

Claude runs section detection on the PDF:

```json
{
  "abstract": {"start": 1, "end": 1},
  "introduction": {"start": 1, "end": 3},
  "methods": {"start": 4, "end": 8},
  "results": {"start": 9, "end": 17},
  "discussion": {"start": 17, "end": 21},
  "references": {"start": 22, "end": 24}
}
```

---

## Phase 1c: Skeleton Creation

Claude creates the summary skeleton file:

```
Creating summary file: chen2024_aptamer_sirna_chimeras_summary.md
Template: templates/summary-skeleton.md
Article type customizations applied
```

```

### Agent 5: Context Agent

```
[■■■■■□] Step 5/6: Assessing context...
  ✓ Overview extracted
  ✓ Methods analyzed
  ✓ Results analyzed
  ✓ Critical analysis complete
  ◉ Context in progress
  ○ Synthesis pending

Reading pages 1-3, 17-21 (Introduction + Discussion)
Writing to: field_impact, future_directions sections
```

### Agent 6: Synthesis Agent

```
[■■■■■■] Step 6/6: Generating synthesis...
  ✓ Overview extracted
  ✓ Methods analyzed
  ✓ Results analyzed
  ✓ Critical analysis complete
  ✓ Context assessed
  ◉ Synthesis in progress

Reading: summary file only (no PDF)
Writing to: insights, takeaways, synthesis sections
```

## Phase 1e: Summary Complete

```
Claude: ✓ Summary complete!

Saved to: chen2024_aptamer_sirna_chimeras_summary.md

All sections completed:
  ✓ Executive Summary
  ✓ Background & Motivation
  ✓ Experimental Approach
  ✓ Results
  ✓ Critical Analysis
  ✓ Bigger Picture
  ✓ Creative Insights
  ✓ Actionable Takeaways
  ✓ One-Paragraph Synthesis
```

## Phase 2: Visual Output Selection

```
Claude: Which visual output format(s) would you like?

1. Interactive HTML report (web presentation)
2. PDF summary (printable document)
3. SVG infographic (visual poster)
4. Multiple formats
5. None (markdown summary only)

## Phase 2b: HTML Generation

```
Claude: Generating Interactive HTML report...

Reading: chen2024_aptamer_sirna_chimeras_summary.md
Applying: prompts/html-report.md template
Using: Brand colors from brand/BRAND_COLORS.md

✓ HTML report generated!
Saved to: chen2024_aptamer_sirna_chimeras_report.html

Features:
- Sticky navigation bar
- Collapsible sections
- Statistical badges with significance styling
- Key figures table
- Critical analysis callouts
```

## Complete File Outputs

After the workflow completes, the user has:

```
chen2024_aptamer_sirna_chimeras.pdf          (original)
chen2024_aptamer_sirna_chimeras_summary.md   (markdown summary)
chen2024_aptamer_sirna_chimeras_report.html  (HTML report)
```

## Timing Expectations

| Phase | Typical Duration |
|-------|------------------|
| Initialization | ~10 seconds |
| Article type selection | User interaction |
| Section detection | ~30 seconds |
| Subagent pipeline (6 agents) | ~3-5 minutes |
| Visual output generation | ~1-2 minutes |
| **Total** | **~5-8 minutes** |

*Note: Timing varies based on paper length and complexity.*

## Troubleshooting This Workflow

### If section detection fails

Claude will use page-ratio fallback:
```
Section detection incomplete. Using estimated page ranges:
- Introduction: pages 1-4 (first 15%)
- Methods: pages 4-7 (15-30%)
- Results: pages 7-16 (30-65%)
- Discussion: pages 16-21 (65-85%)
```

### If a subagent fails

Claude retries once, then falls back:
```
Results agent failed to complete. Retrying...
[Retry successful] or [Falling back to Standard Mode]
```

### If context is exceeded

Claude reduces page range:
```
Context limit reached. Reducing page range for methods agent.
Reading pages 4-6 (reduced from 4-8)
```
