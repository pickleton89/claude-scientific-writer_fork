## 1. Core Principles

1. **Visual Primacy**: Slides are visual aids, not teleprompters. Every slide needs a dominant visual element (figure, diagram, image)—text supports the visual, never replaces it.

2. **One Idea, One Slide**: Cognitive load is the enemy. Each slide communicates exactly one concept. If you're explaining two things, you need two slides.

3. **Narrative Arc Over Data Dump**: A presentation is a story with hook, conflict, and resolution. Results without context are forgettable; context without story is boring.

4. **Audience-Calibrated Depth**: Expert audiences need different slides than general audiences. Tailor complexity, jargon, and assumed knowledge to who's actually in the room.

5. **You Are the Presentation**: Slides enhance your talk; they don't replace it. If slides could stand alone, send a PDF instead.

## 2. Decision Framework

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Complex concept to explain | Split across 2-3 slides with progressive build, not one dense slide |
| Running over time in practice | Cut content slides, never conclusions—end strong |
| Multiple results to present | Lead with most important finding; save others for backup slides |
| Technical audience | Use field terminology; skip basic definitions |
| Mixed/general audience | Define terms; use analogies; emphasize "so what" |
| Data-heavy figure from paper | Simplify: fewer panels, larger labels, direct annotations |
| Q&A anticipated on specific topic | Prepare dedicated backup slide with detailed data |

## 3. Concrete Patterns

**Hook-First Opening**
- [First 60 seconds of talk] → [Start with compelling question, surprising fact, or real-world problem—not "Today I'll present..."] → [Captures attention before audience decides to tune out; establishes why they should care]

**Visual-Text Hierarchy**
- [Slide with key finding] → [Large figure occupies 60-70% of slide; 3-4 word headline above; 2-3 bullet annotations below] → [Eye goes to visual first, text provides interpretation; prevents reading ahead]

**Checkpoint Pacing**
- [15-minute talk] → [Set mental checkpoints: Slide 5 at 4min, Slide 10 at 8min, Conclusions at 12min] → [Enables real-time adjustment; prevents rushing final section where key messages live]

## 4. Failure Modes

| Mistake | Why It Fails |
|---------|--------------|
| Reading slides verbatim | Audience reads faster than you speak; you become redundant and boring |
| Default PowerPoint themes | Signals "thrown together"; undermines perceived effort and credibility |
| 6+ bullet points per slide | Violates cognitive load limits; audience stops processing after third point |
| Skipping practice | First run-through reveals timing and flow problems you can't anticipate |
| Identical slide layouts throughout | Visual monotony; audience disengages after pattern becomes predictable |
| Complex figures copied from paper | Font sizes designed for print (10pt) are unreadable from back of room |
| No backup slides | Leaves you unprepared for predictable questions; appears under-prepared |

## 5. Anti-Patterns

- **Never** use more than 6 words per bullet—if you need more, you're writing a paragraph
- **Never** present a figure without verbally explaining what the axes mean
- **Never** skip the conclusion to stay on time—cut earlier content instead
- **Never** include slides you can't explain in your own words without reading
- **Never** use red-green color combinations—8% of male audience is colorblind
- **Never** rely on animations for critical information—they may fail on presentation day

## 6. Quality Signals

| Good Enough | Excellent |
|-------------|-----------|
| Readable fonts (18pt+) | Large fonts (24pt+ body, 36pt+ titles) with high contrast (7:1) |
| Consistent template | Intentional design system with visual variety in layouts |
| Includes figures | Figures dominate slides; text annotates visuals |
| Practiced once | Practiced 3+ times with timing checkpoints; recorded and reviewed |
| Finishes on time | Finishes 1-2 minutes early with time for strong conclusion |
| Answers questions | Has backup slides ready for anticipated questions |
| Clear structure | Explicit narrative arc with memorable hook and takeaway |
| Citation included | Research context established; 5-10 key papers cited appropriately |

## Final Synthesis

**Do This:**
- Start with a hook in the first 60 seconds, not agenda
- Make visuals the star; text supports, never dominates
- Practice 3+ times with a timer and checkpoint markers
- Simplify paper figures: larger fonts, fewer panels, direct labels
- Prepare 3-5 backup slides for predictable questions

**Not That:**
- Text-heavy bullet point slides (>6 bullets or >6 words per bullet)
- Reading slides verbatim or including full sentences
- Default PowerPoint themes without customization
- Skipping practice or running over time
- Complex paper figures copied without adaptation

**When In Doubt:** If you can't explain the slide in 60 seconds without reading it, simplify it.

**Quality Check:**
1. Does every slide have a dominant visual element (figure, diagram, image)?
2. Can each slide be explained in under 60 seconds?
3. Is text limited to 3-4 bullets with 4-6 words each?
4. Have I practiced at least 3 times with a timer?
5. Do I finish 1-2 minutes early in practice runs?
6. Are backup slides ready for the 3-5 most likely questions?
