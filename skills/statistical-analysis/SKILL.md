## When to Apply This Skill

1. **During analysis planning**: "What test should I use for comparing gene expression between treatment groups?"
2. **Code generation**: "Generate Python code for Mann-Whitney U test with effect size"
3. **Results interpretation**: "Is my p-value of 0.03 significant after testing 20,000 genes?"
4. **Manuscript writing**: "How do I report ANOVA results in a methods section?"
5. **Sample size planning**: "How many samples do I need to detect a 2-fold change in RNA-seq?"
6. **Reviewing statistics**: "Is the statistical approach in this paper appropriate?"

## Typical Workflow

```
1. Define research question → Identify comparison type
2. Assess data characteristics → Check normality, sample size
3. Select appropriate test → Use decision framework
4. Apply corrections → Multiple testing if needed
5. Calculate effect sizes → Biological relevance
6. Report results → Methods + Results sections
```

### Stage 6 Complete: Reporting
**Exit criteria:**

□ Figures show data distribution (not just bar + error bars)
□ All comparisons reported (not just significant ones)

<common_pitfalls>
## Statistical Errors to Avoid

### 1. Multiple Testing Without Correction
Testing 20,000 genes at α=0.05 yields ~1,000 false positives by chance alone.
- **Solution**: Apply Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction; report adjusted p-values

### 2. Pseudoreplication
Treating technical replicates as biological replicates inflates sample size.
- **Solution**: Average technical replicates; use biological replicates for n

### 3. Normality Assumption Violations
Using t-test on count data, percentages, or highly skewed distributions.
- **Solution**: Test normality (Shapiro-Wilk); use non-parametric alternatives

### 4. P-value Misinterpretation
P < 0.05 does NOT mean 95% probability the hypothesis is true.
- **Solution**: Report effect sizes; use confidence intervals; avoid "trending"

### 5. Effect Size Neglect
Statistically significant ≠ biologically meaningful (especially with large n).
- **Solution**: Always report effect sizes (Cohen's d, fold change, R²)

### 6. Batch Effects
Confounding technical variation with biological signal.
- **Solution**: Include batch in model; use ComBat/Harmony for correction

### 7. Overfitting in High-Dimensional Data
More features than samples leads to spurious findings.
- **Solution**: Use regularization; validate on held-out data; report discovery vs validation

### 8. Inappropriate Correlation Interpretation
Correlation ≠ causation; outliers can drive spurious correlations.
- **Solution**: Visualize relationships; use robust methods; consider confounders

### 9. Cherry-Picking Results
Selective reporting of significant results inflates false discovery.
- **Solution**: Pre-register analyses; report all tests performed

### 10. Incorrect Use of Standard Error vs Standard Deviation
SE shows precision of mean estimate; SD shows data spread.
- **Solution**: Use SD for describing variability; SE for comparing means

## How to Report Statistical Results

> **Reference:** See [`QUANTIFICATION_THRESHOLDS.md`](../QUANTIFICATION_THRESHOLDS.md) §10 (Statistical Reporting Completeness) for required elements by test type.

### Methods Section Template
```
Statistical analyses were performed using [Python 3.x with scipy/statsmodels | R 4.x].
[Test name] was used to compare [groups/conditions] because [justification based on
data characteristics]. Multiple testing correction was applied using the
Benjamini-Hochberg procedure with FDR < 0.05. Effect sizes are reported as
[Cohen's d | log2 fold change | Pearson's r]. Sample sizes were determined by
[power analysis | available data], with n = [X] per group providing [Y]% power
to detect [effect size] at α = 0.05.
```

### Results Reporting Format

**t-test**: "Gene expression was significantly higher in treatment vs control
(mean ± SD: 15.2 ± 3.1 vs 8.7 ± 2.4; t(18) = 5.23, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 2.35)"

**ANOVA**: "Expression differed significantly across conditions (F(2, 27) = 12.4,
p < 0.001, η² = 0.48). Post-hoc Tukey tests revealed..."

**Correlation**: "Expression correlated positively with survival time
(Spearman's ρ = 0.68, p < 0.001, 95% CI [0.42, 0.84])"

**Chi-square**: "Mutation frequency differed by cancer type (χ²(3) = 15.7,
p = 0.001, Cramér's V = 0.31)"

## Visualizing Statistical Results

Use **plotting-libraries** skill for creating figures. Match visualization to statistical context:

### Data Assessment Plots
| Purpose | Plot Type | When to Use |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Normality check | Q-Q plot, histogram | Before parametric tests |
| Variance homogeneity | Box plot by group | Before ANOVA/t-test |
| Outlier detection | Box plot, scatter | During data cleaning |
| Distribution shape | Violin plot, density | Choosing test type |

### Group Comparison Plots
| Test Type | Recommended Plots |
|-----------|-------------------|
| t-test, Mann-Whitney | Box plot + individual points, violin plot |
| ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis | Grouped box plot, bar + error bars (with data points) |
| Paired tests | Before-after line plot, paired dot plot |
| Post-hoc comparisons | Box plot with significance brackets |

### Regression & Correlation Plots
| Analysis | Recommended Plots |
|----------|-------------------|
| Linear regression | Scatter + fit line, residual plot, Q-Q of residuals |
| Multiple regression | Partial regression plots, coefficient forest plot |
| Correlation matrix | Heatmap with values, corrplot |
| Logistic regression | ROC curve, calibration plot |

### High-Dimensional Data Plots
| Analysis | Recommended Plots |
|----------|-------------------|
| Differential expression | Volcano plot, MA plot |
| Clustering | Heatmap with dendrograms, silhouette plot |
| Dimensionality reduction | PCA/UMAP scatter, scree plot |
| Multiple testing | P-value histogram, adjusted vs raw p-values |

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Bar plots without individual data points (hides distribution)
- Pie charts for comparing quantities
- 3D plots when 2D suffices
- Dynamite plots (bar + error bar only)
