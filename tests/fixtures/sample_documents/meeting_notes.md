# Weekly Project Sync

## Agenda

1. Review last week's action items
2. Discuss RNA-seq analysis progress
3. Plan validation experiments
4. Timeline review

## Discussion

### Analysis Progress

Bob presented the differential expression results. Key findings include 342 upregulated genes with oxidative phosphorylation enrichment.

> **Note:** The duplicate rate issue was flagged for investigation. May need to re-run library prep for affected samples.

### Validation Planning

Carol outlined the RT-qPCR validation strategy:

| Gene | Primer Status | Priority |
|------|--------------|----------|
| BRCA1 | Ordered | High |
| TP53 | In stock | High |
| EGFR | Ordered | Medium |

## Action Items

- [ ] Bob: Investigate duplicate rate issue by Friday
- [ ] Carol: Begin RT-qPCR when primers arrive
- [x] Alice: Submit GEO upload (completed)
- [ ] All: Review draft methods section
